### Seed project for developing rich client-side applications.
________________
It depends on grunt to run it's tasks. There are not so many tasks, so go take a look at the `Gruntfile.js` in the root directory.

It's included by default

 * HTML5 Boilerplate
 * Twitter Bootstrap
 * AngularJS
 * Karma
 * List of tasks from Grunt
 * A nice directory structure

The rest is self-explanatory.
